This is a simple LAN-based chat application built using Python's socket programming.

## 📘 Features
- Real-time chat between two systems on the same network.
- Simple console interface.
- Uses TCP sockets for reliable communication.

## 🧩 Files
- **server.py** → Run this file on the server system.
- **client.py** → Run this file on the client system.
- **README.md** → Instructions to use the application.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

2. **Start the Client:**
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

3. Both can now send and receive messages.

4. Type **exit** to end the chat.

## 💡 Note
- Ensure both systems are on the same LAN.
- Change `HOST` in `client.py` to the **server's IP address** if not on localhost.
